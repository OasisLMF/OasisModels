# Deterministic Model

This is a single event model which allows users to apply deterministic losses to a portfolio, defining the damage factors in the OED location file. It is similar to the `exposure` feature in the oasislmf package, but can be deployed as a model in it's own right to model deterministic losses which can then be passed through the Oasis financial module.
