# Oasis PiWind Post Loss Amplification

This is a version of the PiWind model with post loss amplification factors applied. Major catastrophic events can give rise to inflated and/or deflated costs depending on that specific situation. To account for this, the ground up losses produced by the GUL calculation component are multiplied by post loss amplification factors, by the component plapy.
